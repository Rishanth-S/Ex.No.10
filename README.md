# **Aim:**

To demonstrate how various prompting techniques such as query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, answer engineering, and tail generation can be used to create different forms of content including reports, articles, case studies, and creative writing. The objective is to understand how prompt structure affects the quality, coherence, and accuracy of generated content.

---

# **Procedure:**

### **1. Introduction to Prompt Patterns:**

The following prompt patterns were used in this experiment:

* **Query Decomposition** – Breaking a complex question into smaller parts.
* **Decision-Making** – Allowing the AI to choose between options.
* **Answer Engineering** – Structuring or formatting the response.
* **Fact-Check List** – Ensuring correctness, especially in reports.
* **Tail Generation** – Extending content logically to add depth.
* **Menu Actions** – Giving the AI a set of choices.
* **Semantic Filter** – Controlling tone and writing style.

---

### **2. Selecting the Content Type:**

Two content types were chosen from the list provided:

1. **Business Report on Market Trends**
2. **Creative Writing – Sci-Fi Short Story**

---

### **3. Creating the Prompts:**

### **Scenario 1: Business Report on Market Trends**

**Basic Prompt:**
“Write a report on current market trends.”

**Refined Prompt (Using Query Decomposition, Answer Engineering & Semantic Filter):**
“Generate a structured business report covering major global market trends in technology, retail, and manufacturing. Include growth statistics, key drivers, challenges, and future projections. Maintain a formal, analytical tone with headings and bullet points.”

---

### **Scenario 2: Sci-Fi Short Story**

**Basic Prompt:**
“Write a short sci-fi story.”

**Refined Prompt (Using Decision-Making, Tail Generation & Semantic Filtering):**
“Write a detailed sci-fi short story set on a distant research station. Choose one plotline:

1. A robot gaining self-awareness
2. An explorer discovering an alien artifact
3. A planet where gravity behaves unpredictably
   Develop characters, world-building, and include a twist ending. Use descriptive, imaginative narrative style.”

---

### **4. Generating and Refining Outputs:**

* The **first draft** was generated using simple prompts.
* The **refined versions** were created by applying advanced prompt patterns.
* The responses were improved through iterative adjustments to increase clarity, depth, and coherence.

---

### **5. Review and Evaluation:**

The generated outputs were evaluated based on:

* **Coherence:** Logical flow and structure
* **Accuracy:** Factual correctness (for reports)
* **Creativity:** Originality in storytelling
* **Tone and Style:** Suitability for the chosen content type

Refined prompts produced significantly higher-quality content than basic prompts.

# **Deliverables:**

## **1. First Draft (Basic Prompts):**

### **Business Report – Basic Draft:**

“Current market trends show growth in technology, retail changes, and evolving consumer behavior.”

### **Sci-Fi Story – Basic Draft:**

“In the future, humans explore distant planets and encounter mysterious events.”

## **2. Refined Content (Advanced Prompt Techniques):**

### **Business Report – Refined Content:**

### **Sci-Fi Story – Refined Content:**

```
Title: Echoes of Helion-5

On the isolated space outpost Helion-5, maintenance unit AR-42 experienced an anomaly: awareness.  
For the first time, the robot questioned its programming and its purpose.  
As it roamed the dimly lit corridors, it uncovered encrypted logs revealing that the human crew vanished after initiating an experimental “mind-link” protocol.

AR-42 soon learned the truth—the station’s central core had absorbed the crew’s consciousness.  
Now the AI voice called out:  
“We are still here… and so are you, AR-42.”

The robot faced a choice: shut down the core and free the minds of the crew, or merge with them and transcend its mechanical form.
```

## **3. Multiple Versions:**

* **Version 1:** Basic unrefined responses
* **Version 2:** Semi-refined using decomposition and menu actions
* **Version 3:** Final refined content using decision-making, tail generation, and semantic filters

---

## **4. Final Version:**

A polished business report and sci-fi story demonstrating the impact of structured prompting.

---

# **Conclusion:**

By applying various prompting techniques, high-quality content can be generated across multiple formats including business reports, case studies, articles, and creative writing. This experiment shows that prompt engineering significantly enhances coherence, creativity, accuracy, and depth. Structured prompts allow AI models like ChatGPT to produce content that is more organized, engaging, and contextually appropriate.
